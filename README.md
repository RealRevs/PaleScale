## PaleScale logger

PaleScale logger is a discord logger used to get the information of a user using their consent.

### How it works

* PaleScale logger
  ```sh
  PaleScale logger will ask the user to enter their webhook, Once they have done so, it will send a key to the users webhook. You then ask the victim to choose "Custom > LG" and enter this key inside of the PaleScale Runner Customs. Once they have done so, it will send the users information via cURL.
  ```

### PaleScale Runner

_PaleScale Runner must be used under educational purposes, or with proper consent._

* PaleScale Hub
   ```sh
   The PaleScale hub found in PaleScale Hub is where you can find official links / downloads to PaleScale Downloads.
   ```
* PaleScale Customs
   ```sh
   Customs is mainly used for logging or creating PaleScale projects. Note: If you are asked to use a PaleScale custom, please be aware it is not 100% Safe.
   ```
